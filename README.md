Hey, i'm emerald! I'm usually only here reporting issues for projects i'm interested in, but i also made the Tagalog (tl-PH) translation for the [Geckium](https://github.com/angelbruni/Geckium) project.

I'm also part of the [Reunion7](https://reunion7.com/) team, an almost 1:1 accurate project that aims to bring back the look and feel of Windows 7 to Windows 10 LTSC 2021. 

I love computers, gaming and other stuff. I'm from the Philippines

If me and you are gonna be honest, what's an Github profile without repositories?
